Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
* In this project we were mocking up the code and design for a smart thermostat. The mock code had to read from a temperature sensor with specific timngs as well as outputting the temperature data along with system state to a UART port.

What did you do particularly well?
* The code and comments were especially clean for this project.  It only ended up utilizing 70k of system memory.

Where could you improve?
* Timeliness was a problem in delivering the code on the pre-approved schedule.  While the final product met all the requirements it was late.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
* This project really gave me a good appreciation for the low level aspects of programming that are involved with designing physical hardware systems and the code that run them.  CC Studio is one of the tools that I've added to my repertiore.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
* All of the low level variable and straight C work were directly transferrable to other projects.  I also plan to use more state machines in the future as they proved invaluable for this assignment.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
* Adaptability was front of mind when desiging this application.
